        "question": "A 24 year old man has poor urine flow and takes a very long time to empty his bladder. He has no other urinary symptoms. He has been well previously apart from one episode of non-gonococcal urethritis 1 year ago. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": [
          "A) Overactive bladder",
          "B) Neurogenic bladder",
          "C) Phimosis",
          "D) Prostatic hypertrophy",
          "E) Urethral stricture"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "E",
        "justification": "Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis for the 24-year-old man is urethral stricture. Urethral stricture is a condition that occurs when the urethra narrows, which can cause difficulty in passing urine and a slow urinary stream. This can lead to a feeling of incomplete emptying of the bladder and a need to strain to empty the bladder completely. Urethral stricture follows previous urethral inflammation due to infection. Other possible causes of these symptoms include prostatic hypertrophy, but this condition is more common in older men, usually over the age of 50. Overactive bladder and neurogenic bladder can also cause urinary symptoms, but they typically present with other symptoms such as urgency, frequency, and incontinence. Phimosis refers to the condition where the foreskin cannot be retracted from the tip of the penis and is unlikely to cause the urinary symptoms described."

        "question": "A 67 year old man is found to have an ejection systolic murmur. He is otherwise well. His pulse is 72 bpm and BP 128/84 mmHg. His chest is clear. Investigations: ECG shows sinus rhythm. Echocardiography shows aortic stenosis, valve gradient 50 mmHg. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, LV ejection fraction 45% (>55). Which is the most appropriate management?",
        "options": [
          "A) Clinical review and echocardiography in 6 months",
          "B) Reassure and discharge",
          "C) Refer for aortic valve replacement",
          "D) Start bisoprolol fumarate and advise review if symptomatic",
          "E) Start lisinopril and advise review if symptomatic"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "justification": "Aortic stenosis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 55% should be referred for consideration of an AVR. Medications should not be started as these have no effect on the valve disease progression and may even cause side effects. The patient needs to start the process of definitive treatment with valve replacement so it is not good practice or safe to either discharge or review in 6 months."

        "question": "A 27 year old woman has muscle weakness which is worse on exercise. When asked to count from one to 100 her voice progressively becomes weaker. She has bilateral ptosis. Which pathophysiological process is most likely to be responsible for this disorder?",
        "options": [
          "A) Autoimmunity",
          "B) Genetic disorder",
          "C) Infarction",
          "D) Malignancy",
          "E) Meningeal infection"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "justification": "Autoimmunity is the most likely pathophysiological process responsible for this disorder. The symptoms described are consistent with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects neuromuscular transmission. The muscle weakness worsens with exercise or prolonged use, and the patient also has bilateral ptosis, which is a common feature of myasthenia gravis. The progressive weakness of voice during counting is a characteristic finding known as the \"fatigue test\". Autoimmune antibodies target the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in impaired transmission of nerve impulses to the muscle."

        "question": "A 60 year old man has 6 months of dry cough and increasing shortness of breath on effort. He was previously fit and well, and is a non-smoker. His temperature is 36.8°C, pulse rate 60 bpm and oxygen saturation 89% breathing air. He has finger clubbing. Cardiac examination is normal, and chest examination reveals bibasal crepitations. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": [
          "A) Bronchiectasis",
          "B) Extrinsic allergic alveolitis",
          "C) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis",
          "D) Lung carcinoma",
          "E) Pulmonary tuberculosis"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "justification": "All of the answers are possible causes of cough, finger clubbing and increasing breathlessness but Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is most likely. The dry cough, increasing shortness of breath on exertion, hypoxia, finger clubbing and bibasal crepitations are all in keeping with IPF. Lung cancer is less likely as the patient is a non-smoker and the signs are bilateral in the chest. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a possible correct answer but it is less common than IPF and it is usually associated with a history of exposure to a specific antigen. Pulmonary TB is less likely as there is no fever, the cough is dry and the signs are bibasal."

        "question": "A 46 year old man has pain in his left leg and tingling in his left big toe. He developed severe lower back pain 1 week ago and he is unable to walk on his left heel. There is loss of pinprick perception over the left great toe. Which nerve root is the most likely to have been affected?",
        "options": [
          "A) L1",
          "B) L3",
          "C) L5",

          "E) S2"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "justification": "L5 is the most likely nerve root to have been affected. The patient has a combination of lower back pain, pain in the left leg, and tingling in the left big toe, which are consistent with the dermatomal distribution of the L5 nerve root. The inability to walk on the left heel suggests a left-sided foot drop, and so is also consistent with L5 nerve root dysfunction. The loss of pinprick perception over the left great toe also suggests involvement of the L5 dermatome."

        "question": "A 65 year old man attends the anticoagulant clinic. He has had a metal mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation. He takes warfarin 7 mg daily. His pulse rate is 70 bpm, irregularly irregular, with a mechanical second heart sound. There are no signs of bleeding. His INR is 5.1. Which is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "options": [
          "A) Continue warfarin at lower dose",
          "B) Continue warfarin at same dose",
          "C) Give vitamin K intravenously",
          "D) Give vitamin K orally",
          "E) Withhold warfarin for 2 days then restart at lower dose"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "E",
        "justification": "It is important to maintain a therapeutic INR to avoid thromboembolism from both the metallic valve and atrial fibrillation. However, we also have to manage the risk of bleeding. With the INR of 5.1 there is a risk of bleeding which can be catastrophic if affecting vital organs such as the brain. In this situation with no bleeding, it is safe to withhold the warfarin for 2 days to allow it to reduce naturally and then perhaps start at a lower dose of warfarin than before. Not stopping warfarin runs the risk that the INR fails to fall with a risk of bleeding (A and B wrong). Reducing the INR too quickly with vitamin K (IV or oral) in the absence of bleeding, can lead to the development of thromboembolisms occurring and also challenges in maintaining future therapeutic levels (requirement for SC heparin)."

        "question": "A 52 year old man has three days of severe epigastric pain, radiating to his back, but no chest pain. He has vomited several times. He was previously well. He drinks approximately 60 units of alcohol a week and smokes 20 cigarettes per day. There is epigastric tenderness but his abdomen is not distended, and bowel sounds are present. Which test would confirm the most likely diagnosis?",
        "options": [
          "A) Abdominal X-ray",
          "B) Gastroduodenoscopy",
          "C) Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration",
          "D) Serum amylase concentration",
          "E) Ultrasound scan of abdomen"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "justification": "Serum amylase concentration would confirm the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient presents with severe epigastric pain, radiating to his back, and vomiting, which are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The presence of epigastric tenderness but not distended abdomen and normal bowel sounds are also consistent with this diagnosis. Serum amylase concentration is an important diagnostic test for acute pancreatitis. Elevated serum amylase levels occur early in the course of the disease and can be measured within hours of symptom onset. Abdominal X-ray, gastroduodenoscopy, serum alkaline phosphatase concentration, and ultrasound scan of the abdomen may be useful in certain cases, but they are not as specific for diagnosing acute pancreatitis as serum amylase concentration."

        "question": "A 24 year old man attends the Emergency Department after 2 days of vomiting. He has type 1 diabetes. He is drowsy but maintaining his airway. His pulse rate is 100 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 96% breathing air. Investigations: Blood capillary glucose 32 mmol/L, Blood capillary ketones 6.2 mmol/L (<0.6), Venous pH 7.15 (7.35–7.45). Which is the most appropriate initial treatment?",

          "E) Subcutaneous insulin"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "justification": "This patient has diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The first step in treatment is intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride to correct dehydration and hyperosmolality. IV insulin will be required but follows initial fluid prescription."

His JVP is not visible. His abdomen is non tender. Investigations: Haemoglobin 168 g/L (130–175), Sodium 148 mmol/L (135–146), Potassium 6.0 mmol/L (3.5–5.3), Urea 25.1 mmol/L (2.5–7.8), Creatinine 184 μmol/L (60–120), Creatine kinase 840 U/L (25–200).

          "E) Sepsis"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "justification": "The most likely cause is acute kidney injury due to hypovolaemia. The observations of tachycardia and hypotension fit this. There are no signs of sepsis or reason why this has developed. The creatine kinase is only minimally elevated and would normally be >10,000 in cases of rhabdomyolysis."

          "E) Right hypoglossal nerve"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "E",
        "justification": "The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for motor function of the tongue, including protrusion and side-to-side movements. Damage to the hypoglossal nerve on one side will cause the tongue to deviate towards the affected side (the stronger left side will push it to the right). In this case, the patient had carotid surgery on the left side, so the right hypoglossal nerve is likely to have been damaged."

        "question": "An 18 year old woman has had 3 years of intermittent zig-zagging and flashing lights in both eyes associated with headache. These episodes occur 2-3 times per month and last approximately half an hour. The symptoms are associated with nausea and vomiting. Her vision is affected at the time of each episode but returns to normal afterwards. ",

          "E) Tension-type headache"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "justification": " The most likely diagnosis is B. Migraine. The classic visual symptoms of zig-zagging and flashing lights, headache, nausea, and vomiting are typical features of migraine with aura. The fact that the patient's vision returns to normal after each episode is also consistent with migraine. Acute glaucoma and retinal detachment may present with sudden onset of symptoms, but these are a 'one off' and persist, and require urgent ophthalmologic assessment. Occipital lobe epilepsy is a possibility but less likely since zig-zags almost always point to migraine rather than epilepsy. Tension-type headache does not typically have visual symptoms."

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "justification": "  Based on the symptoms and signs described, the most likely diagnosis is acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent vision loss. Therefore, the investigation that is most likely to confirm the diagnosis is measurement of intraocular pressure. A high intraocular pressure is characteristic of acute angle-closure glaucoma, although other investigation such as a CT or MR scan of the head may be performed to rule out other causes of the symptoms."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "justification": "The clinical picture is consistent with subacute combined degeneration of the cord, giving a mixture of upper motor neurone (extensor plantars) and lower motor neurone (absent ankle jerks) features. The sensory ataxia (positive Romberg's test and absent position sense in the ankles) is most likely due to dorsal column dysfunction from vitamin B12 deficiency, and this can be confirmed by serum vitamin B12 measurement. Vitamin B12 deficiency of this severity is usually caused by pernicious anaemia. "

        "justification": "The image shows urticarial weals. Initial treatment for this should be a non-sedating H1-antihistamine. The correct answer is thus B (oral loratadine). Chlorphenamine maleate is a sedating antihistamine, which is more likely to cause adverse effects; this patient also specifically requested treatment that would not affect her level of alertness. Prednisolone is effective for severe, acute urticaria but should not be used first-line. Aqueous cream is a soap substitute and has no role in the management of urticaria."

          "E) Retrobulbar optic neuritis"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "E",
        "justification": "The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is retrobulbar optic neuritis. The acute onset of eye pain and marked loss of vision, along with the presence of relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) on the swinging flashlight test, are suggestive of optic neuritis. The absence of optic disc swelling on fundoscopy suggests a retrobulbar lesion. Acute closed angle glaucoma also presents with acute eye pain, but it is typically associated with other features such as vomiting, headaches, and a red eye with a dilated pupil accompanied by high intraocular pressure. Giant cell arteritis can also cause acute visual loss, but it is more commonly seen in older patients and is often associated with systemic symptoms such as headache, jaw claudication, and malaise. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension can cause vision loss and headache, but it typically does not cause pain with eye movements. Migraine with aura can cause visual disturbances, but it is typically not associated with pain, and the presence of RAPD suggests a neuro-ophthalmic rather than a primary headache disorder."

The combination of both lower motor neurone signs (fasciculation) and upper motor neurone signs (brisk reflexes) in the same limb are particularly characteristic of motor neurone disease. Multiple sclerosis is purely upper motor neurone and the options listed (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis, and polymyositis) are purely lower motor neurone conditions."

The appropriate initial treatment would be to start furosemide to reduce the patient’s ankle swelling and to refer the patient to a specialist for further investigation and management of the underlying cause. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle to increase sodium and water excretion, which can reduce oedema. It is a commonly used diuretic in the management of nephrotic syndrome."

        "justification": "The most appropriate topical treatment for Bowen’s disease, a type of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, is 5-fluorouracil (Efudix®) cream. This is a form of topical cytotoxic chemotherapy used to treat both Bowen’s disease and actinic keratosis. It is typically applied to the affected area once or twice a day for 2-4 weeks. An inflammatory reaction, which can be severe, should be expected. Topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone valerate have no effect on Bowen’s disease. Diclofenac can be used in the treatment of actinic keratosis but is not indicated for Bowen’s disease. Isotretinoin gel is a retinoid used in the treatment of acne. Salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent used for hyperkeratotic lesions such as viral warts and sometimes actinic keratoses, but it will not treat the underlying dysplasia effectively."
