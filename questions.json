      "question": "A 24 year old man has poor urine flow and takes a very long time to empty his bladder. He has no other urinary symptoms. He has been well previously apart from one episode of non-gonococcal urethritis 1 year ago. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "A) Overactive bladder",
        "B) Neurogenic bladder",
        "C) Phimosis",
        "D) Prostatic hypertrophy",
        "E) Urethral stricture"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "justification": "Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis for the 24-year-old man is urethral stricture. Urethral stricture is a condition that occurs when the urethra narrows, which can cause difficulty in passing urine and a slow urinary stream. This can lead to a feeling of incomplete emptying of the bladder and a need to strain to empty the bladder completely. Urethral stricture follows previous urethral inflammation due to infection. Other possible causes of these symptoms include prostatic hypertrophy, but this condition is more common in older men, usually over the age of 50. Overactive bladder and neurogenic bladder can also cause urinary symptoms, but they typically present with other symptoms such as urgency, frequency, and incontinence. Phimosis refers to the condition where the foreskin cannot be retracted from the tip of the penis and is unlikely to cause the urinary symptoms described."

      "question": "A 67 year old man is found to have an ejection systolic murmur. He is otherwise well. His pulse is 72 bpm and BP 128/84 mmHg. His chest is clear. Investigations: ECG shows sinus rhythm. Echocardiography shows aortic stenosis, valve gradient 50 mmHg. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, LV ejection fraction 45% (>55). Which is the most appropriate management?",
      "options": [
        "A) Clinical review and echocardiography in 6 months",
        "B) Reassure and discharge",
        "C) Refer for aortic valve replacement",
        "D) Start bisoprolol fumarate and advise review if symptomatic",
        "E) Start lisinopril and advise review if symptomatic"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "Aortic stenosis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 55% should be referred for consideration of an AVR. Medications should not be started as these have no effect on the valve disease progression and may even cause side effects. The patient needs to start the process of definitive treatment with valve replacement so it is not good practice or safe to either discharge or review in 6 months."

      "question": "A 27 year old woman has muscle weakness which is worse on exercise. When asked to count from one to 100 her voice progressively becomes weaker. She has bilateral ptosis. Which pathophysiological process is most likely to be responsible for this disorder?",
      "options": [
        "A) Autoimmunity",
        "B) Genetic disorder",
        "C) Infarction",
        "D) Malignancy",
        "E) Meningeal infection"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justification": "Autoimmunity is the most likely pathophysiological process responsible for this disorder. The symptoms described are consistent with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects neuromuscular transmission. The muscle weakness worsens with exercise or prolonged use, and the patient also has bilateral ptosis, which is a common feature of myasthenia gravis. The progressive weakness of voice during counting is a characteristic finding known as the \"fatigue test\". Autoimmune antibodies target the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in impaired transmission of nerve impulses to the muscle."

      "question": "A 60 year old man has 6 months of dry cough and increasing shortness of breath on effort. He was previously fit and well, and is a non-smoker. His temperature is 36.8°C, pulse rate 60 bpm and oxygen saturation 89% breathing air. He has finger clubbing. Cardiac examination is normal, and chest examination reveals bibasal crepitations. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "A) Bronchiectasis",
        "B) Extrinsic allergic alveolitis",
        "C) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis",
        "D) Lung carcinoma",
        "E) Pulmonary tuberculosis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "All of the answers are possible causes of cough, finger clubbing and increasing breathlessness but Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is most likely. The dry cough, increasing shortness of breath on exertion, hypoxia, finger clubbing and bibasal crepitations are all in keeping with IPF. Lung cancer is less likely as the patient is a non-smoker and the signs are bilateral in the chest. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a possible correct answer but it is less common than IPF and it is usually associated with a history of exposure to a specific antigen. Pulmonary TB is less likely as there is no fever, the cough is dry and the signs are bibasal."

      "question": "A 46 year old man has pain in his left leg and tingling in his left big toe. He developed severe lower back pain 1 week ago and he is unable to walk on his left heel. There is loss of pinprick perception over the left great toe. Which nerve root is the most likely to have been affected?",
      "options": [
        "A) L1",
        "B) L3",
        "C) L5",
        "D) S1",
        "E) S2"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "L5 is the most likely nerve root to have been affected. The patient has a combination of lower back pain, pain in the left leg, and tingling in the left big toe, which are consistent with the dermatomal distribution of the L5 nerve root. The inability to walk on the left heel suggests a left-sided foot drop, and so is also consistent with L5 nerve root dysfunction. The loss of pinprick perception over the left great toe also suggests involvement of the L5 dermatome."

      "question": "A 65 year old man attends the anticoagulant clinic. He has had a metal mitral valve replacement and atrial fibrillation. He takes warfarin 7 mg daily. His pulse rate is 70 bpm, irregularly irregular, with a mechanical second heart sound. There are no signs of bleeding. His INR is 5.1. Which is the most appropriate next step in management?",
      "options": [
        "A) Continue warfarin at lower dose",
        "B) Continue warfarin at same dose",
        "C) Give vitamin K intravenously",
        "D) Give vitamin K orally",
        "E) Withhold warfarin for 2 days then restart at lower dose"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "justification": "It is important to maintain a therapeutic INR to avoid thromboembolism from both the metallic valve and atrial fibrillation. However, we also have to manage the risk of bleeding. With the INR of 5.1 there is a risk of bleeding which can be catastrophic if affecting vital organs such as the brain. In this situation with no bleeding, it is safe to withhold the warfarin for 2 days to allow it to reduce naturally and then perhaps start at a lower dose of warfarin than before. Not stopping warfarin runs the risk that the INR fails to fall with a risk of bleeding (A and B wrong). Reducing the INR too quickly with vitamin K (IV or oral) in the absence of bleeding, can lead to the development of thromboembolisms occurring and also challenges in maintaining future therapeutic levels (requirement for SC heparin)."

      "question": "A 52 year old man has three days of severe epigastric pain, radiating to his back, but no chest pain. He has vomited several times. He was previously well. He drinks approximately 60 units of alcohol a week and smokes 20 cigarettes per day. There is epigastric tenderness but his abdomen is not distended, and bowel sounds are present. Which test would confirm the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "A) Abdominal X-ray",
        "B) Gastroduodenoscopy",
        "C) Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration",
        "D) Serum amylase concentration",
        "E) Ultrasound scan of abdomen"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "justification": "Serum amylase concentration would confirm the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient presents with severe epigastric pain, radiating to his back, and vomiting, which are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The presence of epigastric tenderness but not distended abdomen and normal bowel sounds are also consistent with this diagnosis. Serum amylase concentration is an important diagnostic test for acute pancreatitis. Elevated serum amylase levels occur early in the course of the disease and can be measured within hours of symptom onset. Abdominal X-ray, gastroduodenoscopy, serum alkaline phosphatase concentration, and ultrasound scan of the abdomen may be useful in certain cases, but they are not as specific for diagnosing acute pancreatitis as serum amylase concentration."

      "question": "A 24 year old man attends the Emergency Department after 2 days of vomiting. He has type 1 diabetes. He is drowsy but maintaining his airway. His pulse rate is 100 bpm, BP 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 96% breathing air. Investigations: Blood capillary glucose 32 mmol/L, Blood capillary ketones 6.2 mmol/L (<0.6), Venous pH 7.15 (7.35–7.45). Which is the most appropriate initial treatment?",
      "options": [
        "A) Intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride",
        "B) Intravenous 1.26% sodium bicarbonate",
        "C) Intravenous antibiotics",
        "D) Intravenous insulin",
        "E) Subcutaneous insulin"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justification": "This patient has diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The first step in treatment is intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride to correct dehydration and hyperosmolality. IV insulin will be required but follows initial fluid prescription."

      "question": "A 55 year old man is rescued from a collapsed building where he has been trapped for 12 hours without water. His temperature is 35.6°C, pulse rate 100 bpm and BP 90/42 mmHg. His JVP is not visible. His abdomen is non tender. Investigations: Haemoglobin 168 g/L (130–175), Sodium 148 mmol/L (135–146), Potassium 6.0 mmol/L (3.5–5.3), Urea 25.1 mmol/L (2.5–7.8), Creatinine 184 μmol/L (60–120), Creatine kinase 840 U/L (25–200). Which is the most likely cause of this biochemical picture?",
      "options": [
        "A) Bladder outflow obstruction",
        "B) Direct renal trauma",
        "C) Hypovolaemia",
        "D) Rhabdomyolysis",
        "E) Sepsis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "The most likely cause is acute kidney injury due to hypovolaemia. The observations of tachycardia and hypotension fit this. There are no signs of sepsis or reason why this has developed. The creatine kinase is only minimally elevated and would normally be >10,000 in cases of rhabdomyolysis."

      "question": "A 24 year old woman has diarrhoea. She is HIV positive and has been working in Namibia. Investigation: Faeces microscopy (following modified Ziehl–Neelsen stain): protozoa. Which is the most likely causative organism?",
      "options": [
        "A) Acanthamoeba",
        "B) Cryptosporidium parvum",
        "C) Entamoeba coli",
        "D) Plasmodium falciparum",
        "E) Schistosoma mansoni"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": "Cryptosporidium parvum is the most likely causative organism for diarrhoea in an HIV positive patient working in Namibia. Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that can cause chronic diarrhoea in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS."

      "question": "A 67 year old man has difficulty chewing and speaking. He underwent carotid surgery 2 days agoHis tongue deviates to the right when he is asked to protrude it.",
      "options": [
        "A) Left glossopharyngeal nerve",
        "B) Left hypoglossal nerve",
        "C) Left vagus nerve",
        "D) Right glossopharyngeal nerve",
        "E) Right hypoglossal nerve"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "justification": "The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for motor function of the tongue, including protrusion and side-to-side movements. Damage to the hypoglossal nerve on one side will cause the tongue to deviate towards the affected side (the stronger left side will push it to the right). In this case, the patient had carotid surgery on the left side, so the right hypoglossal nerve is likely to have been damaged."

      "question": "An 18 year old woman has had 3 years of intermittent zig-zagging and flashing lights in both eyes associated with headache. These episodes occur 2-3 times per month and last approximately half an hour. The symptoms are associated with nausea and vomiting. Her vision is affected at the time of each episode but returns to normal afterwards. ",
      "options": [
        "A) Acute glaucoma ",
        "B) Migraine",
        "C) Occipital lobe epilepsy ",
        "D) Retinal detachment  ",
        "E) Tension-type headache"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": " The most likely diagnosis is B. Migraine. The classic visual symptoms of zig-zagging and flashing lights, headache, nausea, and vomiting are typical features of migraine with aura. The fact that the patient's vision returns to normal after each episode is also consistent with migraine. Acute glaucoma and retinal detachment may present with sudden onset of symptoms, but these are a 'one off' and persist, and require urgent ophthalmologic assessment. Occipital lobe epilepsy is a possibility but less likely since zig-zags almost always point to migraine rather than epilepsy. Tension-type headache does not typically have visual symptoms."

      "question": "A 75 year old man has had 3 days of intermittent headaches, blurred vision and vomiting. For the past 24 hours he has had a severe left sided headache and eye pain, accompanied by blurred vision and vomiting. His left eye is red and the left pupil is dilated.",
      "options": [
        "A) CT scan of head",
        "B) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate",
        "C) Fluorescein staining of the cornea",
        "D) Measurement of intraocular pressure",
        "E) MR scan of head  "
      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "justification": "  Based on the symptoms and signs described, the most likely diagnosis is acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent vision loss. Therefore, the investigation that is most likely to confirm the diagnosis is measurement of intraocular pressure. A high intraocular pressure is characteristic of acute angle-closure glaucoma, although other investigation such as a CT or MR scan of the head may be performed to rule out other causes of the symptoms."

She has normal tone of her lower limbs, moderate weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, normal knee jerks, but absent ankle jerks and extensor plantars. Romberg's test is positive. She has reduced vibration sense, and joint position sense is impaired up to the ankle joints. Temperature and pinprick sensations are normal.",

        "E) Serum vitamin D  "
      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "justification": "The clinical picture is consistent with subacute combined degeneration of the cord, giving a mixture of upper motor neurone (extensor plantars) and lower motor neurone (absent ankle jerks) features. The sensory ataxia (positive Romberg's test and absent position sense in the ankles) is most likely due to dorsal column dysfunction from vitamin B12 deficiency, and this can be confirmed by serum vitamin B12 measurement. Vitamin B12 deficiency of this severity is usually caused by pernicious anaemia. "

        "D) Topical aqueous cream",
        "E) Topical hydrocortisone"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": "The image shows urticarial weals. Initial treatment for this should be a non-sedating H1-antihistamine. The correct answer is thus B (oral loratadine). Chlorphenamine maleate is a sedating antihistamine, which is more likely to cause adverse effects; this patient also specifically requested treatment that would not affect her level of alertness. Prednisolone is effective for severe, acute urticaria but should not be used first-line. Aqueous cream is a soap substitute and has no role in the management of urticaria."

      "question": "A 29-year-old woman has 2 days of marked loss of vision and acute pain in her left eye. The pain is worse when she changes her gaze direction. Her eyes appear normal on general inspection. Her vision is 'count fingers only' in the affected eye. The swinging flashlight test shows that the left pupil dilates when a bright light is moved from the right eye to the left eye. The optic discs are normal on fundoscopy.",
      "options": [
        "A) Acute closed angle glaucoma",
        "B) Giant cell arteritis",
        "C) Idiopathic intracranial hypertension",
        "D) Migraine with aura",
        "E) Retrobulbar optic neuritis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "justification": "The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is retrobulbar optic neuritis. The acute onset of eye pain and marked loss of vision, along with the presence of relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) on the swinging flashlight test, are suggestive of optic neuritis. The absence of optic disc swelling on fundoscopy suggests a retrobulbar lesion. Acute closed angle glaucoma also presents with acute eye pain, but it is typically associated with other features such as vomiting, headaches, and a red eye with a dilated pupil accompanied by high intraocular pressure. Giant cell arteritis can also cause acute visual loss, but it is more commonly seen in older patients and is often associated with systemic symptoms such as headache, jaw claudication, and malaise. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension can cause vision loss and headache, but it typically does not cause pain with eye movements. Migraine with aura can cause visual disturbances, but it is typically not associated with pain, and the presence of RAPD suggests a neuro-ophthalmic rather than a primary headache disorder."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justification": "The clinical presentation described in this scenario is consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Ocular involvement occurs in approximately 50% of patients and some of these can experience a range of complications. However, in the majority of cases, there is complete resolution with no sequelae."

        "D) Thiamine",
        "E) Vitamin D"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",

It can be used for this purpose once a week, or daily but omitted on the day of the (weekly) methotrexate dose. Calcium carbonate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamine, and vitamin D are not routinely prescribed as additional treatments for methotrexate. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is usually prescribed alongside isoniazid in the treatment of tuberculosis."

        "E) Polymyositis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": "The most likely diagnosis is motor neurone disease, which is characterised by progressive weakness and wasting of muscles due to degeneration of motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord. The combination of both lower motor neurone signs (fasciculation) and upper motor neurone signs (brisk reflexes) in the same limb are particularly characteristic of motor neurone disease. Multiple sclerosis is purely upper motor neurone and the options listed (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis, and polymyositis) are purely lower motor neurone conditions."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": "Based on the clinical presentation and investigations, the most likely diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome, possibly secondary to the patient’s long-standing polyarthritis. The appropriate initial treatment would be to start furosemide to reduce the patient’s ankle swelling and to refer the patient to a specialist for further investigation and management of the underlying cause. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle to increase sodium and water excretion, which can reduce oedema. It is a commonly used diuretic in the management of nephrotic syndrome."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justification": "The most appropriate topical treatment for Bowen’s disease, a type of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, is 5-fluorouracil (Efudix®) cream. This is a form of topical cytotoxic chemotherapy used to treat both Bowen’s disease and actinic keratosis. It is typically applied to the affected area once or twice a day for 2-4 weeks. An inflammatory reaction, which can be severe, should be expected. Topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone valerate have no effect on Bowen’s disease. Diclofenac can be used in the treatment of actinic keratosis but is not indicated for Bowen’s disease. Isotretinoin gel is a retinoid used in the treatment of acne. Salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent used for hyperkeratotic lesions such as viral warts and sometimes actinic keratoses, but it will not treat the underlying dysplasia effectively."

Given her symptoms of palpitations, hot flushes, tremulousness, and a high pulse rate, the most appropriate initial treatment is propranolol. It works by blocking the effects of thyroid hormones on the heart and peripheral tissues. Propranolol can be started immediately to control the patient’s symptoms while further investigations and management are initiated."

      "question": "An 80-year-old man has an ulcer over the left heel and reduced mobility. He has a loss of appetite. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and has previously had a myocardial infarction. The ulcer is 3 cm in diameter and deeply penetrating. Sensory testing shows reduced vibration sense but normal sensation to light touch. His Doppler ratio (ankle brachial pressure index) on the left is 0.68 and on the right is 0.98 (normal value 1.00). Which is the most likely mechanism of his ulcer?",
      "options": [

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "Delirium is the most likely diagnosis given the patient’s acute onset of confusion, fluctuating level of consciousness, perceptual disturbances, and physical illness (chest infection) as a precipitating factor. Delirium is a common acute neuropsychiatric disorder among hospitalized elderly patients and can be caused by infection, medication side effects, and metabolic derangements. Alzheimer's dementia and Lewy body dementia are chronic neurodegenerative disorders, whereas bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are chronic psychiatric disorders that do not typically present with acute confusion."

      "justification": "The most likely diagnosis given the presentation of the patient is pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The symptoms of excessive tiredness, weight loss, jaundice, and a palpable mass in the epigastric area, along with a history of alcohol use, make pancreatic adenocarcinoma the most probable diagnosis. The presence of a 4 cm liver edge also indicates liver metastasis."

The sudden onset of visual loss, the presence of an afferent pupillary defect, and a red spot (the cherry red spot) on fundoscopy are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient also has risk factors for this diagnosis. In branch retinal vein occlusion, patients typically have multiple retinal haemorrhages in the distribution of the vein. Macular degeneration does not cause sudden onset visual loss, and although both retinal detachment and anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy cause acute visual loss, neither have the fundoscopic findings described."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "justification": "Based on the information given, the most likely cause of her insomnia is a normal age-related sleep pattern. This is because she is able to carry out normal daytime activities with no daytime somnolence, has no history of snoring or other sleep-related symptoms, and has a high MMSE score indicating good cognitive function. It is common for older adults to experience changes in their sleep patterns, such as more fragmented sleep and more frequent awakenings during the night.

She is very tender on palpation in the left lower quadrant. No masses are felt on rectal examination, but there is blood on the glove. Which is the most likely cause of her symptoms?",
      "options": [
        "A) Angiodysplasia",

        "C) Diverticulitis",
        "D) Haemorrhoids",
        "E) Ulcerative colitis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "The most likely cause of the symptoms is diverticulitis, given the left-sided abdominal pain, bloody stools, and tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Other options such as angiodysplasia and haemorrhoids do not typically cause such pain, while colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis are less likely due to the acute nature of symptoms and the absence of weight loss."

        "D) γGT",
        "E) PT"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "justification": "Prothrombin time (PT) is the best marker of liver synthetic function. Paracetamol overdose can cause acute liver damage, leading to impaired synthesis of clotting factors. PT assesses the extent of liver damage and the effectiveness of treatment. ALT and bilirubin reflect liver injury but do not directly assess restoration of liver synthetic function."

        "E) Ventricular tachycardia"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "Premature ventricular beats (ventricular ectopics) commonly cause palpitations with a sensation of sudden heart jumps. The ECG findings of broad-complex ectopics support a ventricular origin. Other arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia are less likely based on the patient’s history and examination."

        "E) Varicocoele"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justification": "The most likely diagnosis is hydrocoele, which is a collection of fluid around the testicle causing painless swelling. The fact that the swelling transilluminates further supports this diagnosis. Inguinal hernias do not transilluminate, torsion is painful, and varicoceles have a 'bag of worms' texture."

        "E) Squamous cell carcinoma"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": "The history of an ulcerated lesion on the ear in an individual likely to have had a high level of ultraviolet light exposure from living in Australia should raise the possibility of a keratinocyte cancer. Given the long history yet small size of the lesion, together with the description of a raised, pale border, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most likely diagnosis. Other characteristic features include a shiny or ‘pearly’ surface, a rolled edge, or overlying telangiectasia."

        "E) Recent catheter change"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "The patient’s fever, mild confusion, and urinary symptoms suggest the presence of a systemic infection, likely a urinary tract infection (UTI) or catheter-related infection given his recent catheter change. This necessitates antibiotic treatment. Blood and protein in the urine are common with catheters and not specific for infection. Dark, strong-smelling urine also does not necessarily indicate infection. Pain alone does not require antibiotics unless associated with other signs of infection."

Anticoagulant therapy, such as apixaban, is recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation and moderate to high stroke risk. Aspirin is not recommended for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and digoxin is used primarily for rate control rather than stroke prevention. Left atrial ablation would only be considered if drug treatment is unsuccessful or unsuitable."

      "justification": "The most appropriate next investigation is an ultrasound of the renal tract. The patient likely has undiagnosed polycystic kidney disease with bilateral renal masses, reduced renal function, and haematuria. A renal ultrasound will rapidly confirm the presence of cysts. An MR scan may be done later to assess renal sizes ahead of possible therapy. Cystoscopy is not required at this stage, and urine cytology would not be beneficial. A CT scan is more appropriate in suspected malignancy or urolithiasis."

        "E) Visual disturbance"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justification": "The abrupt onset of headache is the most concerning feature, suggesting a serious underlying cause such as subarachnoid haemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage. Other possibilities include reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or low-pressure headache. The combination of headache and visual disturbance could also indicate haemorrhage into a pituitary macroadenoma. While nausea, photophobia, and lack of response to paracetamol are notable, they are not as immediately concerning as the abrupt onset."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "justification": "The patient's elevated blood pressure, radiofemoral delay, and chest X-ray findings of notching of the ribs in the mid-clavicular line are suggestive of aortic coarctation. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital defect that results in a narrowing of the aorta, just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery. This can lead to hypertension and other cardiovascular complications. The systolic murmur heard on auscultation may arise from flow across the coarctation itself or associated aortic valve disease."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is the most likely diagnosis based on the history of sinusitis, oral ulceration, haemoptysis, and the bilateral pulmonary nodules on chest X-ray. GPA is a rare autoimmune disease that affects small blood vessels in the body, causing inflammation and tissue damage. The presence of red cell casts in the urinalysis suggests renal involvement, which is also common in GPA."

The clinical features, including sore throat, malaise, intermittent fever, swollen tonsils, yellow-tinged sclerae, and tender lymph nodes, suggest infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). This is a relatively common disease in the 15-25 year old age group and is caused by EBV.

Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but it most commonly involves the terminal ileum. The patient’s symptoms of recurrent mouth ulcers and altered bowel habit are consistent with Crohn’s disease, and the finding of small bowel thickening with enlarged mesenteric nodes on CT colonoscopy is also suggestive."

Co-cyprindiol is a form of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) with anti-androgenic effects, which is licensed for acne. However, it carries a higher risk of thromboembolic disease than other OCPs and is contraindicated here. Desogestrel (when used alone) is a progesterone-only OCP, which may exacerbate acne. Flucloxacillin has no effect on acne. Oral isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne but is usually reserved for severe or scarring disease or when other treatments, including tetracycline antibiotics, have not been sufficiently effective."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "justification": "The most likely diagnosis in this case is primary hyperparathyroidism, as it is characterized by increased serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase. The parathyroid hormone is only slightly elevated, which is still consistent with the diagnosis, as it should be suppressed in the presence of hypercalcemia. Excess calcium intake and vitamin D excess can also cause hypercalcemia but are less likely in this case as the patient does not report any excessive intake of these substances.

      "justification": "Vascular insufficiency is the most likely main cause of erectile dysfunction in this patient. The patient has peripheral vascular disease, and similar vascular disease can occur in the penile blood supply. None of his medications is likely to cause erectile dysfunction, and there are no clinical features of testosterone deficiency. Autonomic neuropathy can contribute to erectile dysfunction in patients with diabetes, but the patient does not have any other features of neuropathic disease.

His liver function tests show a cholestatic pattern with a raised ALP. There is an increased incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. While alcoholic hepatitis is a possibility, an alcohol intake of 20 units per week is not high enough to cause significant damage in an otherwise healthy liver. Cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma are less likely given the short duration of symptoms and lack of specific risk factors, such as viral hepatitis or cirrhosis.

      "justification": "Colonic carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with a six-month history of increased frequency of defecation and three months of dark red rectal bleeding mixed with the stool. The low haemoglobin, low MCV, and low MCH suggest that the patient has iron deficiency anaemia, which is commonly associated with colorectal cancer. The other differential diagnoses, such as diverticular disease, haemorrhoids, ischaemic colitis, and ulcerative colitis, may also cause rectal bleeding, but are less likely to present with such a prolonged duration of symptoms and iron deficiency anaemia. A colonoscopy would be required for confirmation of the diagnosis."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "justification": "The most appropriate next step in pharmacological management would be inhaled tiotropium and salmeterol. This combination therapy is recommended for patients with COPD who have persistent symptoms despite bronchodilator therapy (such as salbutamol) and who have an FEV1 of less than 80% predicted. Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator, while salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator. Together, they work to improve lung function and reduce breathlessness in patients with COPD. Inhaled beclometasone is a corticosteroid inhaler and oral prednisolone is a systemic corticosteroid used for acute exacerbations of COPD rather than chronic management. Nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium bromide is a combination bronchodilator therapy used for acute exacerbations of COPD. Oral theophylline is a bronchodilator that is not typically recommended as a first-line therapy for COPD management."

      "correct_answer": "E",
      "justification": "Zolpidem tartrate is the correct answer as it is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic and sedative and is associated with postural instability and falls. Alendronic acid is a bisphosphonate and is not directly associated with falls. Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitor which is not directly related to falls. Metformin is a biguanide and is not directly associated with falls. Whilst amlodipine can be associated with postural hypotension and subsequent falls, this is not the case in this patient who does not have a postural drop in blood pressure on standing."
